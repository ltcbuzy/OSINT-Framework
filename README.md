OSINT Framework
A lot of open source intelligence (OSINT) resources are gathered and maintained by GmbH. OSINT is everything that can be found online for free. OSINT can be used in a number of ways, but having the ability to find anything you want is crucial in today's society. In RISKREX or OSINT classes, we utilize some of these resources. If you identify a broken link or a missing resource, please contact us via an issue or by mail at code(@)trekr.de.
